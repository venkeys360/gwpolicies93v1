Firewall:  a set of rules to filter traffic
 
1. filters the host IP, destination IP address

2. filter the ports

3. filter the protocols

Firewall:     1. hardware based used in organization network level
			  2. software based used in a sinle machine   ex: mcafee,avasta,windows firewall

Firewall Techniques:

               1. packet filtering :  a. stateful : session less,
													less overhead,
													less memory and time,
													hacker can enters
									  b. stateful : session maintains,
													TCP based,flow control,more overhead,sequential dataflow,
													spoofing of IP cannot possible,
													once connection established packets can flow without furthur checking
			   2. ApllicationLayerGateway(ALG) : application layer gateway applies security mechanisms based on certain applications. like https,tls/ssl,ftp,voip.
			   
			   It looks deeper into protcols and checks whether they are properly used or not looks at layer7.
			   
			   It filters disllowed commands into data streams when filtering at stateful.
			   
			            a. ALG uses (DeepPacketInspection)DPI----- to examine the data that sent in great detail like malware attachements and structure of data being sent.others includes snooping and censoring.
						
						DPI----- deals with protocols and their behaviour
						
						b. DPI evolves into DCI(deep content inspection)---- to examine entire file for malware inspection,spam,key words,data exfilteration.
						
						DCI---- deals with data ,decodes and decompresses the fies.
